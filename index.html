        <p> HackRice is Rice University's annual hackathon event. Participants trade their sleep for a weekend and join a team to create a project - typically software - in an environment optimized for creativity. At the end of the event, the participants demonstrate their projects to fellow hackers, visitors, and a panel of judges. The event is hosted by the Rice Computer Science Club. </p>

	<h1>FAQ</h1>
	<div id="faq-wrap" class="section-text">
		<div class="faq-group">
			<h3> Who is eligible for HackRice? </h3>
			<p>Any US student over the age of 18 is eligible to apply to HackRice 2016. Rice alumni are eligible to attend the event to hack or mentor other students, but alumni submissions will not be eligible for prizes.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="faq-group">
			<h3> What is the acceptance criteria? </h3>
			<p>Rice students and alumni have guaranteed acceptance for Hack Rice. For Non-Rice students, as much as we want to take everyone, we can only accept a limited number of the candidates due to the limited amount of space we have on campus. We think that the fairest way to accept candidates is to ask the candidates to tell us about their previous hackathon and coding experiences, so that we can invite people who have demonstrated interest and skill. The admission process will be competitive and rolling! We also will take into account people who have never been to a hackathon before, so please apply!</p>
		</div>
		<div class="faq-group">
			<h3> Will my travel be reimbursed? </h3>
			<p>Yes! We'll let you know the details soon.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="faq-group">
			<h3> What external sources can I use? </h3>
			<p>Third party libraries and APIs are permitted if they are publicly available and free to use.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="faq-group">
			<h3> What about teams? </h3>
			<p>You don't have to form a team before the event, or at all. At the start of the event, we will provide plenty of time to break out and form a new one if you choose to. Teams will be limited to 5 people.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="faq-group">
			<h3> Will there be prizes? </h3>
			<p>Over $8000 in prizes will be awarded. Cash prizes will be awarded to first, second, and third place winners. There will also be company sponsored prizes as well.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="faq-group">
			<h3> Will there be free food? </h3>
			<p> Yes! We will provide catered meals during the event along with free caffeine!</p>
		</div>
		<div class="faq-group">
			<h3> What if I'm not very experienced? </h3>
			<p>We will try our best to point people in the right direction and use tools and languages that allow rapid development with the least amount of frustration. There will also be upperclassmen participating in the hackathon who can help you out. Furthermore, you can look up tutorials and sample code online. We will also be having workshops the week before the hackathon!</p>
		</div>
		<div class="faq-group">
			<h3> What do I need to bring? </h3>
			<p>Please bring a student ID so we can verify and register you on-site! You'll also need to bring a computer and whatever software you feel might be necessary for development. We also recommend that you bring power strips for convenience. Teammates are free to share equipment with each other.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="faq-group">
			<h3> Do I need to stay the entire time? </h3>
			<p>Nope, we are not a lock-in. We realize that 36 hours is a long time, and that some people might have other commitments during that time. Feel free to stay and leave as you choose. However, we would prefer that people stay to promote the environment. Furthermore, we will have bedding for people who want to sleep!</p>
		</div>
		<div class="faq-group">
			<h3> More questions? </h3>
