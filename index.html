        <p> HackRice is Rice University's annual hackathon event. Participants trade their sleep for a weekend and join a team to create a project - typically software - in an environment optimized for creativity. At the end of the event, the participants demonstrate their projects to fellow hackers, visitors, and a panel of judges. The event is hosted by the Rice Computer Science Club. </p>

	<h1>FAQ</h1>
	<div id="faq-wrap" class="section-text">
		<div class="faq-group">
			<h3> Who is eligible for HackRice? </h3>
			<p>Any current student over the age of 18 is eligible to apply to
            HackRice. Since we are a MLH member ever, participants must also
            accept the <a href="http://static.mlh.io/docs/mlh-code-of-conduct.pdf">MLH Code of Conduct</a></p>
		</div>
		<div class="faq-group">
			<h3> Can Rice alumni attend? </h3>
            <p>
                Rice alumni are eligible to attend the event to hack or mentor
                other students, but alumni submissions will not be eligible for
                prizes. We will not be able to reimburse alumni for travel.
                To register as an alumni visit <a href="/alumni"> our alumni page.</a>
            </p>
		</div>
		<div class="faq-group">
			<h3> What is the acceptance criteria? </h3>
			<p>Rice students and alumni have guaranteed acceptance for Hack Rice. For Non-Rice students, as much as we want to take everyone, we can only accept a limited number of the candidates due to the limited amount of space we have on campus. We think that the fairest way to accept candidates is to ask the candidates to tell us about their previous hackathon and coding experiences, so that we can invite people who have demonstrated interest and skill. The admission process will be competitive and rolling! We also will take into account people who have never been to a hackathon before, so please apply!</p>
		</div>
		<div class="faq-group">
			<h3> Will my travel be reimbursed? </h3>
			<p>Yes! We'll be providing travel reimbursements for all visiting
            hackers. Click <a href='/travel'>here</a> for details.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="faq-group">
			<h3> What external sources can I use? </h3>
			<p>Third party libraries and APIs are permitted if they are publicly available and free to use.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="faq-group">
			<h3> What about teams? </h3>
			<p>You don't have to form a team before the event, or at all. At the start of the event, we will provide plenty of time to break out and form a new one if you choose to. Teams will be limited to 5 people.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="faq-group">
			<h3> Will there be prizes? </h3>
			<p>We will have prizes for 1st, 2nd, 3rd place, as well as a best
            hardware hack, and several other company sponsored prizes.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="faq-group">
			<h3> Will there be free food? </h3>
			<p> Yes! We will provide catered meals during the event along with free caffeine!</p>
		</div>
		<div class="faq-group">
			<h3> What if I'm not very experienced? </h3>
			<p>We will try our best to point people in the right direction and use tools and languages that allow rapid development with the least amount of frustration. There will also be upperclassmen participating in the hackathon who can help you out. Furthermore, you can look up tutorials and sample code online. We will also be having workshops the week before the hackathon!</p>
		</div>
		<div class="faq-group">
			<h3> What do I need to bring? </h3>
			<p>Please bring a student ID so we can verify and register you on-site! You'll also need to bring a computer, whatever software you feel might be necessary for development, sleeping bag, and pillow. We also recommend that you bring power strips for convenience. Teammates are free to share equipment with each other.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="faq-group">
			<h3> Do I need to stay the entire time? </h3>
			<p>Nope, we are not a lock-in. We realize that 36 hours is a long time, and that some people might have other commitments during that time. Feel free to stay and leave as you choose. However, we would prefer that people stay to promote the environment. </p>
		</div>
        <div class="faq-group">
            <h3> Mentoring Program? </h3>
            <p>
                We’ve set up a mentoring slack for HackRice that you can access by going to <a style="text-decoration:underline"  href="http://hack.rice.edu/live/">http://hack.rice.edu/live/</a> and clicking on Request a Mentor.  If you’ve not already joined the slack, use the dropdown to select your email address domain and enter your email to log in. If you don’t see your email domain send an email to <a style="text-decoration:underline;font-weight:300;" href="mailto:hackricementoring@gmail.com" class="link">hackricementoring@gmail.com</a> and we’ll promptly get you added.
                Once you’re part of the Slack, you will be added to the <b>#general</b> and <b>#mentorrequests</b> channels. Use the general channel for any general questions that can be answered straight from Slack. If you need a mentor, request one through the #mentorrequests channel and follow the guideline for stating your problem. Also, if you have a question about a very specific topic you can use one of the pre-existing channels or create your own.
                All mentors who have checked in will also be added to a private channel which they can use to help pair hackers requesting help with mentors and coordinate with each other.
            </p>

    <div class="section-text">
        <p>
            Sponsors help support every aspect of HackRice. Contributions from
            sponsors go towards the costs of space rentals, food, t-shirts,
            transportation, staffing expenses, and many, many other things that
            make a hackathon successful and exciting. Being a HackRice sponsor
            allows you to reach out to talented students looking to innovate
            and build awesome projects. Sponsors can get involved at many
            levels, check out our sponsorship packet or shoot us an email to
            find out how you can be a part of our greatest hackathon yet!
