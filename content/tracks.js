They can be used to enhance the best aspects of human nature (such as empathy, creativity, and generosity), or they can allow the worst aspects of it (such as prejudice, selfishness, and irrational thinking) to flourish and cause harm. Incorporating ethics into design and coding involves trying to anticipate all the ways – positive and negative – humans may use and interact with tech. While it’s difficult to exert complete control over human users, tech can be designed to promote particular behavior and outcomes."

                Based off the CSS Zen Garden, this track aims to show you the power of HTML and CSS.
                <br />
                <br />
                CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets with an emphasis placed on “Style.” While HTML is used to structure a web document (defining things like headlines and paragraphs, and allowing you to embed images, video, and other media), CSS comes through and specifies your document’s style—page layouts, colors, and fonts are all determined with CSS.

                <br />
                "Although there are new tools and technologies to help with frontend design, we want to focus our attention back on the basics. CSS is a powerful and often overlooked tool, and with this design track, we hope you will learn something new about CSS.")

    // "Accessibility and visual appeal are vital attributes of any app or website’s user interface. While still remaining functional on the back end, many apps and websites on many different platforms have deplorable user interfaces that needs lots of work.  This year’s HackRice “reDesign” track hopes to improve those interfaces.  Using your knowledge of design and graphics, you will be tasked with redesigning the user interface of an app or website used by the public today that you believe needs overhaul"

And as IIoT becomes pervasive at the wellsite, this problem will only grow.​ Show us how to do it better!
