Since we are an MLH member event, participants must also accept the <a href=\"http://static.mlh.io/docs/mlh-code-of-conduct.pdf\">MLH Code of Conduct.</a></li><br />\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<li><h3>Will my travel be reimbursed?</h3>Yes!

More details coming soon!</li><br />\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<li><h3>Will there be prizes?</h3>We will have prizes for 1st, 2nd, 3rd place, several track prizes, and many other company sponsored prizes.</li><br />\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<li><h3>Will there be free food?</h3>Yes! We will provide catered meals during the day along with snacks and free caffeine through the night to keep you going.</li><br />\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<li><h3>What are the acceptance criteria?</h3>Rice students and alumni are guaranteed acceptance. For Non-Rice students, we ask for their previous hackathon and coding experiences, so that we can invite people who have demonstrated interest and skill. The admission process will be competitive and rolling! We also will take into account people who have never been to a hackathon before, so please apply!</li><br />\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<li><h3>What do I need to bring?</h3>Please bring a student ID so we can verify and register you on-site! You'll also need to bring a computer, whatever software you feel might be necessary for development, sleeping bag, and pillow. We also recommend that you bring power strips for convenience. Teammates are free to share equipment with each other.</li><br />\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<li><h3>What if I'm not very experienced?</h3>We will try our best to point people in the right direction and use tools and languages that allow rapid development with the least amount of frustration. There will also be upperclassmen participating in the hackathon who can help you out. Furthermore, you can look up tutorials and sample code online. We will also be having workshops the week before the hackathon!</li><br />\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<li><h3>Can Rice alumni attend?</h3>Rice alumni are eligible to attend the event to hack or mentor other students, but alumni submissions will not be eligible for prizes. We will not be able to reimburse alumni for travel.</li><br />\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<li><h3>What if I don't have a team before the event?</h3>You don't have to form a team before the event, or at all. At the start of the event, we will provide plenty of time to break out and form a new one if you choose to.</li><br />\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<li><h3>Do I need to stay the whole time?</h3>Nope, we are not a lock-in. We realize that 36 hours is a long time, and that some people might have other commitments during that time. Feel free to stay and leave as you choose. However, we would prefer that people stay to promote the environment.</li><br />\n\n\t\t\t\t\t</ol>\n\t\t\t\t\t{close}\n\t\t\t\t</article>\n\n\t\t\t\t<article\n\t\t\t\t\tid=\"contact\"\n\t\t\t\t\tclassName={`${this.props.article === 'contact' ?
