			<h1>Judging and Prizes</h1>

<p>Teams will have an opportunity to present their applications on Sunday evening to the audience and a panel of 2 judges.</p>

<p>We will not judge code quality or style. However, it is recommended that you write clear and readable code to enable your team to work more efficiently.</p>

<p>Catagories and prize amounts will be declared in the near future, once we finalize the sponsorship logistics.</p>
<!-- 
<p>Applications will be judged for the following category prizes. Teams may win across multiple categories. For each category, there will be a 1st place prize of $100 per team member and a runner-up prize of $50 per team member. Prizes will be awarded after the event in the form of a prepaid card.</p>
