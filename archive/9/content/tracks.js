They can be used to enhance the best aspects of human nature (such as empathy, creativity, and generosity), or they can allow the worst aspects of it (such as prejudice, selfishness, and irrational thinking) to flourish and cause harm. Incorporating ethics into design and coding involves trying to anticipate all the ways – positive and negative – humans may use and interact with tech. While it’s difficult to exert complete control over human users, tech can be designed to promote particular behavior and outcomes."

                Based off the CSS Zen Garden, this track aims to show you the power of HTML and CSS.

                <br />
                CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets with an emphasis placed on “Style.” While HTML is used to structure a web document (defining things like headlines and paragraphs, and allowing you to embed images, video, and other media), CSS comes through and specifies your document’s style—page layouts, colors, and fonts are all determined with CSS.

                    At Bill.com, we are constantly looking for new and exciting ways to make
                    it simple for business owners to connect and do business. To this year's
                    hackers we ask: "What are some outside of the box ways to leverage
                    technology to accomplish this?"
                </p>
                <p>
                    We want to challenge you to reimagine our user experience by embedding
                    Bill.com everywhere, and will be providing home devices, smartwatches and
                    tablets for anyone interested in developing on these systems.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Bill.com team will work closely with hackers to leverage the Bill.com
                    API and client libraries, and host a Q&A workshop to help get teams up and
                    running with their projects. We look forward to meeting all of the this
                    year's participants and seeing what you all come up with!

                <p>
                    Background: Chevron has large scale operations and complex process facilities (refineries and
                    liquified natural gas production facilities). Scheduling work orders on these facilities with differing repair
                    requirements, specialized technicians, and potentially hours of drive time between locations can be
                    difficult.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Challenge: Build a work order tracking system that tracks (1) the work orders that are submitted and
                    (2) the technicians that are completing them to optimize how technicians are assigned and work orders
                    are completed. Knowing where technicians are, what they are certified/qualified to repair, how long they
                    are planning to being there, other work orders in the same or nearby location, etc will be invaluable in
                    being able to dynamically schedule and dispatch existing and new work orders to technicians at the
                    beginning of the day and while onsite. Updating each technician with their schedule of work orders can
                    be done through any means of mobile technology, SMS, call, mobile app, etc.

                    A pilot decides she wants to go flying this weekend because the weather is
                    really nice, but she can’t decide where she wants to go. We know what airports
                    she’s flown to in the past; what’s an airport she’s never been to but would
                    enjoy flying to? Use our historical data to build a machine learning model that
                    can recommend a new flying destination. Then, if you’re up for the challenge,
                    package the model into an iOS app for on-the-go flight planning!
