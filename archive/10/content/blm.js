  <span style={{ fontWeight: "600"}}>The HackRice team stands in solidarity with Black activists and allies fighting against police brutality and systemic racial injustice. </span>
  The killings of George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor, and countless others before them weigh heavy on our hearts, 
  and it is clearer than ever the urgency and necessity of taking action to combat the systematic racism that exists in our country and the world.

  <span style={{ fontWeight: "600"}}>We do not tolerate any kind of hatred, discrimination, or violence. </span> 
  HackRice has been and will always be about engaging and empowering students, regardless of background, 
  to create and innovate using technology to make the world a better place. 
  We recognize that the Computer Science community and the technology industry at large can and must do significantly more to support the black community and fight racism, 
  and we will actively support the movement in every way that we can through our platform and our choice of theme, sponsors, workshops, and admissions.

  Weâ€™ve taken the last few weeks to reflect on our position within the Rice and tech community and how we can do better to support the black tech community. 
  Our application review process this year will heavily weight the responses to our short answer questions over resumes to work towards more equitable admissions, 
  as our priority is passion for and investment in computer science and technological advancement. 
  Our breakout sessions will include networking sessions dedicated to supporting underrepresented communities. 
  We are waiting to release our official theme and tracks, but they will focus on health and sustainability - that of social, environmental, public, community, and personal.
