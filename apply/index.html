        <h3>METRO Rail</h3>
        <p>The Metropolitan Transit Authority of Harris County, (METRO) provides bus and Rail service from destinations around Houston.</p>
        <p>The Houston <a href='http://www.greyhound.com/en/locations/terminal.aspx?city=681440'>Greyhound bus station</a> is next to the <a href='http://www.ridemetro.org/SchedulesMaps/RailSched.aspx'>METRORail</a> line. The rail line travels up and down Main Street, serving downtown, the Texas Medical Center and Reliant Park. There is a stop across the street from the main entrance of the Rice campus.</p>
        <h3>Parking</h3>
	<p>If you are driving in by car, please use <a href="http://business.rice.edu/Directions_Parking.aspx">these instructions</a> to park in the underground garage (Central Campus Garage)  beneath the Jones Graduate School of Business (McNair Hall). To park in this garage, enter from Rice Boulevard (Entrance #20) and turn right at the second stop sign. The building and entrance to the garage will be on your left.</p>
	<p>Validation Passes: We will provide you 2 validation passes for the event. Each validation pass will cover the cost of upto 24 hours. Upon exit, insert the VALIDATION FIRST then the ticket for parking. Since you need to use the validation passes upon exit, you can only exit once up to 24 hours before you intend to leave Rice on Sunday and still have your parking completely paid for. Parking not covered by the validation passes will cost $1 per 12 minutes, $11 daily maxium. If you want to leave and come back more frequently, you can park at the significantly cheaper Greenbriar Lot which is $1 per entry per day. It's approximately a 15 minute walk from Greenbriar Lot to Brockman Hall.</p>
	<p>Important: Because you will be parking overnight. Please call from INTERCOM when you arrive at the gate and give to the attendant on duty information that you'll be parking overnight and are here on an event with the CS department. They will take information about your car and phone contacts. This is Rice's procedure and is necessary just in case of an emergency. If you do not inform the attendant, you risk your car getting towed.</p>

    <h1>FAQ</h1>
    <ul class='rules-list'>

    <li>
        <strong>Will there be prizes?</strong><br>
        Over $6000 in prizes will be awarded. Cash prizes will be awarded to first, second, and third place winners. We will also have "24-hours of prizes" where a random participant is awarded a random prize every hour.</li>

    <li>
        <strong>Will there be free food?</strong><br>
        Yes! We will provide catered meals during the event along with free caffeine!</li>

    <li>
        <strong>What if I'm not very experienced in programming?</strong><br>
        We will try our best to point people in the right direction and use tools and languages that allow rapid development with the least amount of frustration. There will be upperclassmen participating in the hackathon who can help you out. Furthermore, you can look up tutorials and sample code online.</li>

    <li>
        <strong>Do I need to bring my own laptop?</strong><br>
        Yes. Unfortunately, we can't provide computers or equipment. Please bring a computer with you and whatever software you feel might be necessary for development. For example, if you plan to make an iOS application, make sure you have a developer license and Xcode downloaded. We also recommend that you bring power strips for convenience. Teammates are free to share equipment with each other.</li>

    <li>
        <strong>Do I need to form teams before the event?</strong><br>
        You don't have to form a team before the event. At the start of the event, we will provide plenty of time to break out and form the teams. </li>

    <li>
        <strong>Do I need to stay for the entire time?</strong><br>
        Nope, we are not a lock-in. We realize that 24 hours is a long time, and that some people might have other commitments or even want to shower or sleep. Feel free to stay and leave as you choose. However, we would prefer that people stay to promote the collaborative environment.</li>

    <li>
        <strong>Do I need to be present for the awards and judging?</strong><br>
        We would require that at least 1 person from your team be present to demonstrate the application for judging and awards.</li>
